## Academic Interests

#### Hello all, 
#### I am a graduate student pursuing my masters degree in Information Technology and Management at Illinois Institute Of technology. My specialization is Software Developement.

## Repository Contents

### Github Lab

#### Steps done for Github Lab : Created a simple readme.md file inside the repository cloned from my github profile. The readme file had basic information about me. Created a hello world example program to test it under node js, which simply prints Hello Ritesh Shenoy B.Used the commands necessary for initialisation, creation of package.json and edited the file to fill in with details such as description, author etc and created a new script. Rather than running the command "node index.js" used the "npm run" command over the newly created script to run "node index.js". Pushed all the changes made to the local computer to GitHub.
